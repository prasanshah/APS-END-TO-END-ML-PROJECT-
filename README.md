APS-END-TO-END-ML-PROJECT

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The project involves building a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict whether the Air Pressure System (APS) of a heavy vehicle is functioning correctly. The APS is critical for the vehicle's braking mechanism, which often uses hydraulic press technology. A faulty APS can lead to accidents, making its proper maintenance vital for safety.
This project leverages sensor data to determine the APS's condition. The dataset consists of binary labels indicating whether an accident was caused by a faulty APS (1 for faulty, 0 for functional). By analyzing patterns in the data, the ML model will classify the APS as "faulty" or "functional," enabling preemptive action to prevent failures.
